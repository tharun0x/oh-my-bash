Oh My Bash is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) configuration.

## I've made some changes to the cupcake theme as I saw fit. you can clone this if you wanna try my theme.

### The Theme looks like what you see below.

```shell
‚îåüî∫ User ‚ãà Desktop in ~
‚îî‚ùØ
```
### see `image.png` for actual theme look (with colours).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

__Disclaimer:__ _Oh My Bash works best on macOS and Linux._

### Replace the `.bashrc` file in your home directory with the `.bashrc` file that comes with this repo. (i.e) oh-my-bash/.bashrc

## Using Oh My Bash

#### Manual Installation

##### 1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://git.selfmade.ninja/tharunmurphy/oh-my-bash.git
```

##### 2. *Optionally*, backup your existing `~/.bashrc` file:

```shell
cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.orig
```

##### 3. Create a new bashrc configuration file

You can create a new sh config file by copying the template that I have included for you.

```shell
cp ~/oh-my-bash/.bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

##### 4. Reload your .bashrc

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

##### 5. Initialize your new bash configuration

Once you open up a new terminal window, it should load the shell with the new configuration.

## Always Backup your original files and directories before making any changes.
